# HyperSudokuSolver
Design and implement a program to solve Hyper Sudoku puzzles

Hyper Sudoku differs from the classic Sudoku in that four overlapping regions are defined in addition to the regular regions, as described below. The rules of the game are:

• The game board consists of 9 × 9 cells divided into 3 × 3 non-overlapping regions. Four additional overlapping regions are defined, as highlighted in green. The game board therefore contains 9 non-overlapping regions and 4 overlapping regions, with each region containing 3 × 3 cells. Some of the cells already have numbers (1 to 9) assigned to them initially.

• The goal is to find assignments (1 to 9) for the empty cells so that every row, column, nonoverlapping region and overlapping region contains all the digits from 1 to 9. Each of the 9 digits, therefore, can only appear once in every row, column, non-overlapping region and overlapping region.
